🏛️ 1. Theme Intelligence Platform (TIP) - 5-Layer Design
Current Roadmap Position:

v2.8: Basic theme generation (what we're building)
v3.0: FCM with atomic packages
v4.0-5.0: THIS IS WHERE TIP LIVES!

Phased Implementation:
v4.5: Foundation

Layer 1: Formal schema (Faelight Spec v1)
Layer 2: Eval engine (color computation)

v5.0: Intelligence

Layer 3: Advanced templating
Layer 4A: Basic prediction (time/wallpaper-based)

v5.5+: Advanced Intelligence

Layer 4B-D: Learning, anomaly detection, theme diff
Layer 5: Full lifecycle management


📊 2. Performance Profile Analyzer
Where it fits:

v3.5-4.0 as "Advanced Tooling"
Pairs perfectly with dot-benchmark (already in roadmap!)

Suggested name: theme-perf or perf-profile
Mini spec:
bashtheme-perf analyze     # Run performance analysis
theme-perf report      # Show findings
theme-perf optimize    # Suggest improvements
theme-perf profile gaming  # Switch to performance profile

🤖 3. ML-Like Predictive Features
Heuristic intelligence - VERY achievable!
Where it fits:

v4.0-4.5 (Theme Intelligence Engine)

This could work with:

Fish shell history
Hyprland window tracking
Time-based patterns


🛡️ 4. Security Dashboard TUI
Where it fits:

v2.9-3.0 (Security & Backup phase)
Could replace/enhance current security-check script

Tech stack:

Python + Rich/Textual for TUI
Integration with existing security tools
Theme-aware colors (brilliant idea!)
